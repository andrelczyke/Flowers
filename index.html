            <h2>Aluna</h2>
            Not gonna lie<br>
            You are rare <br>
            Not my type<br>
            But you make me feel good<br>
            Said bye-bye Makes me cry Sometimes,<br>
            yeah When I got nothing better To do,<br>
            I think of you<br>
            It don't mean nothing more than<br>
            An excuse to keep me amused<br>
            And I don't waste my time Wishing you would be mine<br>
            And don't hit my line 'cause<br>
            It's only when there's nothing better To do,<br>
            I think of you (You, you)<br>
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specime<br>
            book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of<br>
            Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br>
            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
            Why do we use it?<br>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted<br>
            by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of<br>
            using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as<br>
            opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many<br>
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default<br>
            model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their<br>
            infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
            sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).<br>
            all mine But you can give me heartache<br>
            When I got nothing better To do, I think<br>
            of you It don't mean nothing more than<br>
            An excuse to keep me amused And I don't<br>
            waste my time Wishing you would be mine<br>
            And don't hit my line 'cause It's only<br>
            when there's nothing better To do, I <br>
            think of you (You, you)
